# CIS129_Bonus_Project
Bonus Project with Ty Huetter

Your users will be students trying to register for their next semester's classes. At an absolute
 minimum, a user should be able to add and remove classes (in an easily usable way) and see a
 list of classes they're currently registered for (formatted nicely). Creativity will be appreciated!
 Speaking of creativity, note that you are not required to use real PCC course/department names
 or even set your program at PCC at all. (How would registration work at Hogwarts? Starfleet
 Academy? Mars University?)
 
 Deliverables
 I expect three main deliverables:
 ● Adesign/planning document. This doesn't need to be in any particular format, but I want
 to see that you really thought about what the program was going to do (and, possibly, not
 do) and how it was going to do it. (Actually, it would be great if you could turn this in
 before you even start coding, but that's not mandatory.)
 ● All the actual code needed to run your program. One long Python source code (*.py)
 file is okay.
 ● Apost-mortem document. Tell me what went well with your project and what went
 not-so-well.
 As always, I'll read any comments or additional materials you have too, but the three things
 above will be the graded parts.
